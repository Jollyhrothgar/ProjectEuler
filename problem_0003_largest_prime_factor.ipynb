    "A factor is a number that divides into another number without a remainder. That is to say, $m$ is a factor of $N$ if $N \\over m$ is a whole number.\n",

    "## Method 1\n",

    "In principal, one could use a factoring method for two purposes - both to get factors AND to check if a number is prime, because prime numbers only contain two factors - one and itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "I suspect that there are both efficient factoring algorithms and efficient prime number algorithms out in the world, but that there are many fewer prime numbers in between 1 and any integer $N$ than there are factors. Given this, I suspect that the most efficient solution will be first to generate primes, and then to check which primes are factors.\n",
